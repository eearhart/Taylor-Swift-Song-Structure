#Taylor Swift Song Structure Analysis
This repository is the home for an ongoing data analysis project I am working on studying the song structure, patterns, formulas, and techniques used by Taylor Swift to create those "raging bops" (official terminology.) 
The goal of this project is to figure out the magic behind Ms. Swift's tunes, of course, but mostly I'm using it to learn and practice core data analysis skills and programs like spreadsheets, SQL, and Tableau, as well as python, relational database management, machine learning, and community contribution sites like kaggle and (obviously) github.  
Final Note: this is the first coding I've done without guidance from any number of youtube video bootcamps.
